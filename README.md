## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, GitHub! 

I'm Alexander Blad, a student at Brigham Young University - Idaho currently studying Physics, with interests in data science, machine learning, and just programming in general. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
- I'm currently learning Numerical Modeling, Linear Algebra, and Partial Differential Equations for my courses this semester, and recently have taken up the challenge of switching from Windows to Linux as my daily driver OS.
- My goals are to apply the analytical skills I am gaining through my degree program to solve the problems that I face each days.
- I currently work as a tutor for an online education company. This has presented a few opportunities to allow me to do some very basic data analysis, and I have also been doing a lot of the IT work around the office lately. It's a great way for me to practice my skills.
- Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or advice!

## Technologies and Tools

-Proficient in: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), C#, C++
-Learning: C, Game Development, Data Structures, Algorithm Design
-Skills: Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Probabilistic Modeling
